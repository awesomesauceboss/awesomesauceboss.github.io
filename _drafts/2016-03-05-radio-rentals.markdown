project_title: Radio Rentals
agency: Rysen
position: Digital Designer
scope: eDM responsive templates, eDM design, wireframing, online ads
gradient: "linear-gradient(135deg, #ddeec5, #b2e7fa)"
primary_content: With email marketing becoming more crucial in the retail sector, Radio Rentals wanted to be sure their marketing collaterals are well received in every device possible. My challenge was to keep the usual brand guidelines and their love for dynamic graphics within a template guideline. Creating a mobile first design was crucial to making sure the design is visually striking on every device.
secondary_content: Radio Rentals also occasionally rolls out new campaigns, which can be a challenge to create an exciting look and feel thatâ€™s different to the previous campaigns. The look and feel has to fit well across online ads and various digital collaterals, while keeping the crucial elements of the brand.
