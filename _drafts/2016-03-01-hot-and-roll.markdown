scope: Interior graphics, menu boards, uniforms, illustrations
gradient: "linear-gradient(135deg, #fffbb2, #fab2dc)"
primary_content: Hot & Roll is a major food franchise in Malaysia that has recently expanded into Sydney. They cater wholesomely wrapped Malaysian treats such as rotis, crepes and papiahs. With 1 store opened in the food court of Castle Towers, Hot & Roll planned to open a new one in Chinatown at the beginning of 2015.
secondary_content: I was tasked with creating the interior and graphic direction of the new store, making sure the overall visuals matched the existing menu boards. A problem Hot & Roll had with their store in the foodcourt was that a lot of consumers were unfamiliar with Malaysian cuisine and therefore were wary and often confused about how and what to order. I had to make sure the menu boards and infographics clearly educated customers and helped them in the ordering process.
