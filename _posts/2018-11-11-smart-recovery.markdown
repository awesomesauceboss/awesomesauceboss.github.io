SMART Recovery is a not-for-profit organisation who provides programs for assisting people who want to take control of their addiction. Its programs are guided by trained peers, professionals and researchers using cognitive behaviour therapy and other motivational strategies.

## Challenges
Thanks to a government grant, SMART Recovery were able to get funding to build an app that could put their programs to practice and help their partner, University of Wollongong, with their research.

The app will provide various tools to assist the user with existing methods developed by SMART Recovery, such as planning their 7-day plan and logging their urges. It will also conduct surveys to collect information used for research. The information will also be used to show users their progress. Given the sensitive nature of this topic, upholding user privacy is of utmost importance.s

## UX Methodologies and Research
Research was conducted using heat maps, funnels and surveys. We found that users had to do a lot of scrolling to be able to find relevant information or to find controls that helped with filtering. We also found that the amount of promotions above the fold on the homepage was overwhelming and unnecessary as users only seemed to interact with the lead carousel.

## Solution
We created a sleeker UI and minimised the amount of colours to match the new brand’s look and feel. The monotone colour palette was also used to help complement the variety of brand campaigns.

On the homepage, the hierarchy and spacing between promotions has been improved to help with the visual flow. We moved the more popular or important sections (product categories, booking an eye test) to the top of the page. The homepage also includes some personalisation options for a logged-in user. The website will serve personalised promotions based on the user’s purchase history as well as eye test reminders.

The extremely long mobile has been replaced with curtain level navigation. The use of imagery also helps place some more context to the user. Predictive search as well as categorising the search results has been implemented to improve the search experience. We made sure the user can see all of the most important items at first glance with some smaller details such as sticky filters on the product listing page and having the ‘add to cart’ button sticky on mobile. Users can now find their existing contact lens prescription when they have logged in, making their contact lens purchase experience much more easier.
