SMART Recovery is a not-for-profit organisation who provides programs for assisting people who want to take control of their addiction. Its programs are guided by trained peers, professionals and researchers using cognitive behaviour therapy and other motivational strategies.

## Challenges
Thanks to a government grant, SMART Recovery were able to get funding to build an app that could put their addiction recovery programs to practice, as well as assisting their partner, the University of Wollongong, with their research efforts.

## UX Methodologies and Research
Lo-fi prototypes were made and tested with volunteers and SMART Recovery facilitators. After user feedback the lo-fi prototypes were amended and developed into hi-fi prototypes. These hi-fi prototypes were against user tested for further feedback.

## Solution
Privacy was the number 1 priority for the app as we had to make sure users felt safe using it. Some people didn’t want to be in a situation where a loved one, a workmate or their boss might accidentally open the app. Therefore, we implemented a requirement to open the app with a pin code as well as trying to make the app’s name as vague as possible. As for user data being used for research, this information is explicitly mentioned during sign up as well as in person during meetings by the facilitator when introducing the app. As of now, the app can only be downloaded by users who attend the SMART Recovery meetings.

An emergency urges button was added to provide motivational messages, personal photos, videos, voice recordings to help the user during their times of urges. A notification is sent to the user 1-2 hours after pressing the button, encouraging them to reflect upon several things during the time of their urge: what were the triggers, how they felt, what tactics they used or can use to overcome the urge. Users can look at their urge tracker to further allow them to understand when they usually have urges and what their usual triggers are, equipping them with better solutions for dealing with their next urge.

Personalisation is added via the ‘Me’ section with the ability to add photos, videos, voice recordings, personal quotes, as well as emergency contact numbers. We also wanted to convey positivity and encouragement through the visual aesthetic and use of animations throughout the app. Through the user testing, we found that users were overall happy to see the amount of personalisation in the app and excited to see that they can log their 7-day plan, urges and progress in a more discreet way.
