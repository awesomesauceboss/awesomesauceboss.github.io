primary_content: Kahlon Estate Wines esteems itself with having the best quality wines from the finest of vines in South Australia. They had trouble portraying this message to their consumers, particularly consumers from China who visit Australia to purchase quality wines. Some consumers had also given feedback that the wine labels seem a little dull and not of high quality. With the new couple wines, Oberon & Titania (Midsummer Nightâ€™s Dream), Kahlon Estate Wines, hope to change the portrayal of their previous wine labels and add a touch of luxury.
