title: Sharon Peng | Designer - Bubblefish
project_title: Bubblefish
agency: Bubblefish
position: Freelance Designer
scope: Logo, branding, digital and print collaterals, brand guidelines, iconography, social media
gradient: "linear-gradient(135deg, #ddeec5, #b2e7fa)"
primary_content: Bubblefish is a brand strategy and design agency with a 10 year history. With a new direction in the business, Bubblefish felt their current brand identity was no longer accurately represented their philosophy. I was tasked with representing Bubblefish as the mature agency that they are along with portraying adaptability, trustworthiness and professionalism.
secondary_content: A brand strategy had already been predetermined with the concept of “Scaling Up”, which links metaphorically to fish ladders that assist salmon in travelling upstream. Like a fish ladder, Bubblefish assists other businesses of any size or sector in scaling up to the next level.
