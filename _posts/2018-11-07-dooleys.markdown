Dooleys is a Catholic Club as well as a community and entertainment hub. They approached us to refresh their website, one that has not seen any updates since 2012.

## Challenges
As there were not much data about Dooleys’ services and how the website is used, a user survey and feedback was conducted to find out what could be improved. Through our surveys we found that the website’s use of stock imagery did not sit well with the users as they felt it didn’t connect with their tight knit community.

We learned that things like opening hours and latest news were important to users but were hard to find or navigate to. Users would circumvent using the website by collecting a Dooleys magazine when visiting, or calling the office to enquire about opening/closing times.

It was hard to navigate the events page as users found it hard to easily see what’s on the weekend or on a special day, like a birthday. The dining section was a problem for those who frequent the restaurants as they weren’t able to see photos of the actual food or see their menu. The photos on the website used stock imagery, which was not helpful.

## Solution
The community Dooleys serves is a multicultural one and therefore multilingual. Our utmost priority was to make sure all modules of the website supported the languages used most commonly in the local community.

A refresh to the look and feel to the website’s design, images and content was needed. The content especially needed to reflect the local community that Dooleys has been supporting for many years. The homepage now highlights information deemed most important by the community, such as latest news, upcoming events and operating hours.

The events section was redesigned to allow users to easily navigate upcoming events. We divided events into different sections: what’s on today, weekend and weekly activities. Users are also able to select via a calendar if there is an event on a particular date.

We also improved the IA structure by collating some of the links around the website to a more cohesive menu. For example, the old website contained some community updates on the footer, which we moved to the menu.

To support the renewed attention to content, we also had to make sure the website could be easily updated by staff. To achieve this, I was put in charge of making sure the CMS was easy to use and navigate for the marketing team.
