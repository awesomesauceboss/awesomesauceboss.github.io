primary_content: Café Malon is a Chilean and Latin American style café specialising in South American coffee and traditional dishes such as empanadas and panqueques. The name Malon is derived from an old Chilean word for community or gathering. The café wanted its brand identity to reflect its speciality in coffee. The rustic look and feel is adapted to the brand  to highlight the aroma of the coffee and also present a down to earth personality.
